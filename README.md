1. **Phylogenetic Tree with Out-Group**
     - [Tree with Out-Group](http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/?treeid=56061aeff0961536a1b1749a109746b0&algid=)
   - This tree suggests that the initial host of COVID-19 was **OK017858.1 Sarbecovirus**.

2. **Phylogenetic Tree without Out-Group**
     - [Tree without Out-Group](http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/?treeid=b53206dd174baee42988930817579b59&algid=)
   - Without the out-group function, the tree presents a different interpretation of the evolution of COVID-19.

3. **Notes on Interpretation**
   - While it is commonly believed that COVID-19 originated from the **Palm Civet**, the phylogenetic trees in the provided links suggest a different initial host.
